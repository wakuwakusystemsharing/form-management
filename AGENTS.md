# Agent instructions

- **Project context:** Read [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for architecture, commands, API, and constraints.
- **Cursor rules:** Apply rules in [.cursor/rules/](.cursor/rules/). When editing form types, normalizer, FormEditor, or static generators, follow the **form-feature-checklist** rule (four-point update and use `normalizeForm()` only).
